# Sql Project
<br>
This is my first SQL project where I gained insights using SQL queries on a MySQL database. Through this project, I learned a lot about writing queries, subqueries, and joins, which helped me become more familiar and confident with SQL.

 In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data using SQL. The dataset included various pizza categories, pizza names, and different sizes. I explored and extracted key revenue-related insights using SQL queries.
